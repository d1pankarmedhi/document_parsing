However, EPS fell 23% YoY (2% below our forecast) due to margin erosion (gross margins were \\ndown 10 ppt YoY) from higher raw material/manufacturing/logistics costs, and as Tesla has been slashing \\nvehicle prices (down 9% YoY).  \\n➢ TSLA is down 53% since our initiating report in April 2022, wherein we had predicted 39% downside \\nrisk.\\n➢ According to the  International Energy Agency (IEA), 10.3M Electric Vehicles (EV) were sold in 2022 (up \\n49% YoY, accounting for 14% of global vehicle sales). The IEA is forecasting 35% YoY growth in 2023, \\naccounting for 18% of global vehicle sales.\\n➢ Tesla sold 0.42M vehicles in Q1-2023, or 13% of the largest auto manufacturer (Toyota/TSE: 7203), 13% \\nof global EV sales, and 2% of global vehicle sales. Yet, Tesla remains the largest auto manufacturer by \\nMCAP ($513B) – 2.8x Toyota’s MCAP ($186B).   \\n➢ We are continuing to run our valuation models assuming Tesla will capture 40% of the global EV market \\n(12%  of  global  auto  sales)  by  2030.  However,  due  to the reasons mentioned  above,  we  are  lowing  our \\nmargin forecasts. Our revised DCF valuation is $157/share (previously $207/share), which is 3% below \\nthe current share price of $162.\\n➢ We believe the current share price reflects an implied market share of 41% of EV sales (12% of global \\nauto sales) by 2030. For comparison, Toyota’s current share is 16% of global sales.  \\n➢ Our fair value estimate is 23% below the consensus estimate of $203/share (range: $115 to $300/share). \\n15 out of 31 analysts have a BUY rating (Source: TipRanks).  \\n➢ Our  valuation  ranges  between  $32  and  $332  per  share,  when  we  adjust  our  2030  EV-market  share \\nforecast from 15% to 75%.  \\n➢ As most of the legacy automakers have long track records, and are spending heavily on their EV initiatives, \\nwe are expecting stiff competition, and do not believe Tesla will be able to dominate the market over the \\nlong-term.  \\n➢ Based on our revised fair value estimate of $157/share, we believe the shares are fully valued. \\n*See last page for important disclosures, rating, and risk definitions.

Equity Rating Scale: \\nBuy – Annual expected rate of return exceeds 12% for micro & small cap companies, and 8% for mid & large cap companies. \\nHold – Annual expected rate of return is between 5% and 12% for micro & small-cap companies, and 5% and 8% for mid & large-cap companies. \\nSell – Annual expected rate of return is below 5% or the expected return is not commensurate with risk. \\nSuspended or Rating N/A— Coverage and ratings suspended until more information can be obtained from the company regarding recent events. \\nFundamental Research Corp.  Risk Rating Scale: \\n1 (Low Risk) - The company operates in an industry where it has a strong position (for example a monopoly, high market share etc.) or operates in a \\nregulated industry.  The future outlook is stable or positive for the industry.  The company generates positive free cash flow and has a history of profitability.  \\nThe capital structure is conservative with little or no debt. \\n2 (Below Average Risk) - The company operates in an industry where the fundamentals and outlook are positive.  The industry and company are relatively \\nless sensitive to systematic risk than companies with a Risk Rating of 3.  The company has a history of profitability and has demonstrated its ability to \\ngenerate positive free cash flows (though current free cash flow may be negative due to capital investment).  The company’s capital structure is conservative \\nwith little to modest use of debt. \\n3 (Average Risk) - The company operates in an industry that has average sensitivity to systematic risk.  The industry may be cyclical.  Profits and cash \\nflow are sensitive to economic factors although the company has demonstrated its ability to generate positive earnings and cash flow.  Debt use is in line \\nwith industry averages, and coverage ratios are sufficient. \\n4 (Speculative) - The company has little or no history of generating earnings or cash flow.  Debt use is higher.  These companies may be in start-up mode \\nor in a turnaround situation.  These companies should be considered speculative. \\n5 (Highly Speculative) - The company has no history of generating earnings or cash flow.  They may operate in a new industry with new, and unproven \\nproducts.  Products may be at the development stage, testing, or seeking regulatory approval.  These companies may run into liquidity issues and may rely \\non external funding.  These stocks are considered highly speculative. \\nDisclaimers and Disclosure \\nThe opinions expressed in this report are the true opinions of the analyst about this company and industry.

However, EPS fell 23% YoY (2% below our forecast) due to margin erosion (gross margins were \\ndown 10 ppt YoY) from higher raw material/manufacturing/logistics costs, and as Tesla has been slashing \\nvehicle prices (down 9% YoY).  \\n➢ TSLA is down 53% since our initiating report in April 2022, wherein we had predicted 39% downside \\nrisk.\\n➢ According to the  International Energy Agency (IEA), 10.3M Electric Vehicles (EV) were sold in 2022 (up \\n49% YoY, accounting for 14% of global vehicle sales). The IEA is forecasting 35% YoY growth in 2023, \\naccounting for 18% of global vehicle sales.\\n➢ Tesla sold 0.42M vehicles in Q1-2023, or 13% of the largest auto manufacturer (Toyota/TSE: 7203), 13% \\nof global EV sales, and 2% of global vehicle sales. Yet, Tesla remains the largest auto manufacturer by \\nMCAP ($513B) – 2.8x Toyota’s MCAP ($186B).   \\n➢ We are continuing to run our valuation models assuming Tesla will capture 40% of the global EV market \\n(12%  of  global  auto  sales)  by  2030.  However,  due  to the reasons mentioned  above,  we  are  lowing  our \\nmargin forecasts. Our revised DCF valuation is $157/share (previously $207/share), which is 3% below \\nthe current share price of $162.\\n➢ We believe the current share price reflects an implied market share of 41% of EV sales (12% of global \\nauto sales) by 2030. For comparison, Toyota’s current share is 16% of global sales.  \\n➢ Our fair value estimate is 23% below the consensus estimate of $203/share (range: $115 to $300/share). \\n15 out of 31 analysts have a BUY rating (Source: TipRanks).  \\n➢ Our  valuation  ranges  between  $32  and  $332  per  share,  when  we  adjust  our  2030  EV-market  share \\nforecast from 15% to 75%.  \\n➢ As most of the legacy automakers have long track records, and are spending heavily on their EV initiatives, \\nwe are expecting stiff competition, and do not believe Tesla will be able to dominate the market over the \\nlong-term.  \\n➢ Based on our revised fair value estimate of $157/share, we believe the shares are fully valued. \\n*See last page for important disclosures, rating, and risk definitions.

The company generates positive free cash flow and has a history of profitability.  \\nThe capital structure is conservative with little or no debt. \\n2 (Below Average Risk) - The company operates in an industry where the fundamentals and outlook are positive.  The industry and company are relatively \\nless sensitive to systematic risk than companies with a Risk Rating of 3.  The company has a history of profitability and has demonstrated its ability to \\ngenerate positive free cash flows (though current free cash flow may be negative due to capital investment).  The company’s capital structure is conservative \\nwith little to modest use of debt. \\n3 (Average Risk) - The company operates in an industry that has average sensitivity to systematic risk.  The industry may be cyclical.  Profits and cash \\nflow are sensitive to economic factors although the company has demonstrated its ability to generate positive earnings and cash flow.  Debt use is in line \\nwith industry averages, and coverage ratios are sufficient. \\n4 (Speculative) - The company has little or no history of generating earnings or cash flow.  Debt use is higher.  These companies may be in start-up mode \\nor in a turnaround situation.  These companies should be considered speculative. \\n5 (Highly Speculative) - The company has no history of generating earnings or cash flow.  They may operate in a new industry with new, and unproven \\nproducts.  Products may be at the development stage, testing, or seeking regulatory approval.  These companies may run into liquidity issues and may rely \\non external funding.  These stocks are considered highly speculative. \\nDisclaimers and Disclosure \\nThe opinions expressed in this report are the true opinions of the analyst about this company and industry.
